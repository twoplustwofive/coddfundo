Blockchain

MOTIVATION FOR CODEFUNDO:

During elections there are many events where the EVM's have been tampered, database tinkering, faulty polling, the process is rushed and tiring for the electorate. Hence we can see
this becomes major concern for security and trust among the citizens. The total expense in 2019 Indian lok sabha elections was expected to 6500 Crores. The main reason behind the expenditure of huge amount
is because of the lacs of EVM's, manpower, location rent, etc. The voting percentage is low as much around 50% in India, the main 
reason being the process is offline hence people avoid going to the booths. 
Hence, Blockchain technology being more secure, reliable, trustful and cost efficient to the people and goverment. 


Azure Blockchain allows us to ‌innovate the three major procedure of an election:
A.) Contending Elections
My software based on AzureBlockchain Technology identify data of voters issued by government authority in form of ID's and boimetric data collected online.  
This data is used for registration — to match a voter with his or her digital identity in a government voter registration database. Increasingly, biometrics 
like iris and face data are being configured. This AzureBlockchain Stores 
the complete identity of voter and is immutable as well as concealed. The idenitity of an individual is secured using CryptoTechnology.
B.) Referendum
I am currently working on a project building software that uses facial and iris recognition to store as well as truthfullness of
voter identity. After taking referendum of every voter, the votes are stored in AzureBlockchain Storage that contains secure cloud 
database that is tamper-proof via blockchain’s immutable ledger technology. 
C.) Polling
In this software, the API would check whether the particular vote belongs to identified person in the ledger, the vote will be counted if it's a legimate vote otherwise discarded. Subsequently processing all the votes.
Software would sort out the number of votes to each and every Party contesting elections and hence the party with Majority of votes 
would be declared as the winning party with precision.
